Why ScrapegraphAI?
==================

ScrapegraphAI in our vision represents a significant step forward in the field of web scraping, offering an open-source solution designed to meet the needs of a constantly evolving web landscape. Here's why ScrapegraphAI stands out:

Flexibility and Adaptability
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Traditional web scraping tools often rely on fixed patterns or manual configuration to extract data from web pages. ScrapegraphAI, leveraging the power of LLMs, adapts to changes in website structures, reducing the need for constant developer intervention. 
This flexibility ensures that scrapers remain functional even when website layouts change.
